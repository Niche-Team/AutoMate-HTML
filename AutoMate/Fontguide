Here is the typography breakdown for the AutoMate template.

The design uses a highly unified and modern approach. Instead of loading multiple different font families, it relies on a single typeface with varying weights and sizes to create a clean visual hierarchy, plus one font specifically for icons.

### 1. Primary Text Font

* **Font Family:** **Inter** (with standard `sans-serif` as a fallback).
* **Source:** Google Fonts (`https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter...`).
* **Weights Loaded:** Light (300), Regular (400), Medium (500), SemiBold (600), and Bold (700).
* **Where it is used:** Every single piece of readable text on the page. The Tailwind configuration explicitly maps both `font-sans` and `font-display` strictly to "Inter".

### 2. Iconography Font

* **Font Family:** **Material Symbols Outlined** (by Google).
* **Where it is used:** Every icon on the page. This includes:
* The main car logo (`directions_car`)
* The search button (`search`)
* The video play button (`play_circle`)
* The floating tags on the car (`verified`, `history`)
* The Trust Strip icons (`gavel`, `published_with_changes`, `engineering`, `local_shipping`)
* The footer social/contact icons (`public`, `alternate_email`, `rss_feed`)
* The chatbot trigger button (`smart_toy`)

### 📏 How "Inter" is Applied Across the Page (The Hierarchy)

Here is exactly how the Inter font is sized and weighted across the different elements to create contrast:

**The Hero Section**

* **Main Headline ("The End of Car Buying Anxiety"):** Bold (700). Massive sizing (`text-5xl` to `text-7xl` depending on screen size).
* **Top Orange Badge ("Nigeria's Premier Marketplace"):** SemiBold (600), extra small (`text-xs`), uppercase, and tracking wide (letter-spacing).
* **Hero Sub-headline ("Verified sellers..."):** Regular (400), large sizing (`text-lg` to `text-xl`), with relaxed line height.
* **Stat Numbers ("15k+", "98%", "24/7"):** Bold (700), large size (`text-3xl`).
* **Stat Labels ("Cars Sold"):** Regular (400), small size (`text-sm`).

**Navigation & Buttons**

* **Site Logo Text ("AutoMate"):** Bold (700), extra-large (`text-2xl`), tight letter spacing.
* **Navigation Links ("Buy a Car", etc.):** Medium (500), small size (`text-sm`).
* **Main Action Buttons ("Browse Inventory", "Sign In"):** Medium (500). Size varies from `text-sm` for the nav button to `text-base` for the hero buttons.

**Image Overlays & Trust Strip**

* **Floating Car Tags ("Verified Inspection", "Full History"):** The titles are Bold (700) and extra small (`text-xs`). The subtext below them is incredibly small (`text-[10px]`).
* **Trust Strip Titles ("No Hidden Fees"):** Bold (700), small size (`text-sm`).
* **Trust Strip Subtext:** Regular (400), extra small (`text-xs`).

**Footer & Chatbot**

* **Footer Column Headers ("Buying", "Selling"):** Bold (700), standard size.
* **Footer Links & Paragraphs:** Regular (400), small size (`text-sm`).
* **Copyright & Legal:** Regular (400), small size (`text-sm`).
* **Chatbot "Ami V.1 Online" Badge:** Bold (700), extra small (`text-xs`), uppercase, wider tracking.
